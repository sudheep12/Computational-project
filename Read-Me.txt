Effective Prediction of BankRuptcy using Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Inference System using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Deep neural network.
- We have developed this project using Matlab and Rapid Miner neural network.


Methodology 1: Fuzzy Logic

- Open Mat lab and open the folder "Fuzzy Logic (Mamadani)".
- In console, type Fuzzy. It will open a Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.
- In Menubar, Click File and import the developed project file named Fuzzy Logic.fis
- Then the model will be opened. We can see the fuzzy rule base and other parameters.
- Predicted output can be seen

Methodology 2: Fuzzy Inference system using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering.

- Open Matlab and Open folder "FIS using FCM".
- Open the file "FisUsingFCM.m". This the main project file developed.
- Check the path of the data file named "Qualitative_Bankruptcy.data".
- Click on the Run Button. Then the file runs properly and it displays the newly created fuzzy infernece system and accuracy of the model.
- Type command "showrule(fis)" to show rules.
- Type the command "fis.output.range" to view output range
- Type command "output = evalfis([2;3;1;2;1;3], fis)" to view the final output.

Methodology 3: Neural Network

- Install Rapid miner tool.
- Open Rapid miner and open folder "NeuralNet".
- Load the developed project file "bankruptcy prediction neuralnet.rmp"
- Import the data from "Qualitative_Bankruptcy.data".
- All the parameters are already set. Click on Run button to view the output.
